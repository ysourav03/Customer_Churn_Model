### Customer_Churn_Model

# Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a bank using machine learning techniques. The goal is to identify customers likely to close their accounts and understand the factors driving their decisions. By predicting churn, the bank can implement targeted strategies to retain customers and improve satisfaction.

# Problem Statement
Customer churn is a critical issue for banks, as retaining existing customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. By analyzing customer data, we aim to:
1.Identify customers at risk of churning.
2.Understand the key factors contributing to churn.
3.Provide actionable insights for customer retention.

# Dataset
The dataset contains both personal and banking details of customers, including:
1.Personal Details: Age, gender, marital status, etc.
2.Banking Details: Total balance, account number, account activity status, transaction history, etc.
3.Target Variable: Indicates whether a customer has churned (Yes/No).

# Data Preprocessing:
1.Handle missing values and outliers.
2.Encode categorical variables.
3.Normalize numerical features for model compatibility.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
1.Understand key trends and relationships in the data.
2.Visualize churn distribution and influencing factors.

# Feature Engineering:
1.Create new features to enhance model performance.
2.Select relevant features using statistical methods.

# Model Development:
1.Build and evaluate machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Networks.
2.Compare models based on performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

# Model Deployment:
1. A web app built using Streamlit allows users to input customer data and get predictions in real-time.
